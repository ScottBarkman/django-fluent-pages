.. _ecms_plugins.formdesignerlink:

The ecms_plugins.formdesignerlink module
========================================

The `formdesignerlink` plugin displays a form, created by
the `django-formdesigner <https://github.com/philomat/django-form-designer>`_ module.

.. note::
    While the `formdesigner` interface may not be fully representive for "ECMS standards" in terms of ease of use,
    it is however a popular module, and hence this plugin is provided!

Installation
------------

Add the following settings to ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'formdesigner',
        'ecms_plugins.formdesignerlink',
    )

Each page can now be enriched with a form, that was created by the `formdesigner` application.

Configuration
-------------

To customize the output, configure the ``django-form-designer`` application via the settings file.
Some relevant settings are:

``FORM_DESIGNER_DEFAULT_FORM_TEMPLATE``
    Defines the default template to use to render a form.
    For example, the template can be rendered with ``django-uni-form``.

``FORM_DESIGNER_FORM_TEMPLATES``
    Defines a list of choices, to allow users to select a template.

``FORM_DESIGNER_FIELD_CLASSES``
    A list of choices, to define which Django field types are allowed.
